## Task Summaries

0. **Sigma is for Sum**: 
    - Calculate the sum \( \sum_{i=2}^{5} i \).

1. **The Greeks pronounce it sEEgma**: 
    - Evaluate the expression \( \sum_{k=1}^{4} (9i - 2k) \).

2. **Pi is for Product**: 
    - Compute the product \( \prod_{i=1}^{m} i \).

3. **The Greeks pronounce it pEE**: 
    - Evaluate the product \( \prod_{i=0}^{10} i \).

4. **Hello, derivatives!**: 
    - Find the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) for the function \( y = x^4 + 3x^3 - 5x + 1 \).

5. **A log on the fire**: 
    - Differentiate \( x \ln(x) \) to find \( \frac{d (x \ln(x))}{dx} \).

6. **It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere**: 
    - Compute the derivative \( \frac{d (ln(x^2))}{dx} \).

7. **Partial truths are often more insidious than total falsehoods**: 
    - Evaluate the partial derivative \( \frac{\partial f(x, y)}{\partial y} \) for \( f(x, y) = e^{xy} \).

8. **Put it all together and what do you get?**: 
    - Calculate the mixed partial derivative \( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y \partial x}(e^{x^2 y}) \).

    - Implement a function to calculate \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \) without using loops.

10. **Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work**: 
    - Write a function to compute the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients.

11. **Good grooming is integral and impeccable style is a must**: 
    - Calculate the indefinite integral of a polynomial.

12. **We are all an integral part of the web of life**: 
    - Evaluate an integral expression related to \( e \).

13. **Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once**: 
    - Compute the output of a definite integral.

14. **My talents fall within definite limitations**: 
    - Determine the limit of a function at certain points.
