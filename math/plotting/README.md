## Project Overview

This project covers data visualization concepts using line graphs, scatter plots, logarithmic scales, histograms, and stacked bar graphs, utilizing **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** throughout.

## Key Features

- **Line Graphs**: Ability to create line graphs to represent mathematical functions or datasets clearly.
- **Scatter Plots**: Plot scatter graphs to visualize relationships between two variables with customizable aesthetics.
- **Logarithmic Scales**: Implement logarithmic scales for data representation, useful in exponential decay and growth contexts.
- **Histograms**: Generate histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data, such as grades or scores.
- **Stacked Bar Graphs**: Create stacked bar graphs to compare quantities across different categories visually.
- **Combined Plots**: Combine multiple plots into a single figure with organized layout options for comprehensive data representation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library

## Task Summaries

0. **Line Graph**: 
    - Create a line graph of \( y = x^3 \) from 0 to 10 using a solid red line.

1. **Scatter**: 
    - Plot a scatter graph of height vs. weight with labeled axes and magenta points.

2. **Change of Scale**: 
    - Plot a line graph representing exponential decay of C-14, with a logarithmic y-axis.

3. **Two is Better Than One**: 
    - Display two line graphs (C-14 and Ra-226) on the same plot with distinct styles and a legend.

4. **Frequency**: 
    - Create a histogram of student grades with specific axis labels and a title.

5. **All in One**: 
    - Combine all previous plots into a single figure with a specified grid layout and title.

6. **Stacking Bars**: 
    - Generate a stacked bar graph showing the quantity of various fruits owned by three individuals.
