## Project Overview

This project covers fundamental concepts of linear algebra, focusing on vectors and matrices. It includes operations such as slicing, transposing, and element-wise manipulation using Python, particularly with NumPy. The aim is to build a strong foundational understanding of matrix shapes, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication.

## Key Features

- **Matrix Slicing**: Allows for extracting segments of lists and matrices without using loops or conditionals.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Implements a method to return the transpose of a matrix, ensuring the original data structure remains unchanged.
- **Element-wise Operations**: Supports addition and arithmetic operations on arrays and matrices, facilitating easy mathematical manipulations.
- **Shape Computation**: Provides functionalities to compute and return the shape of matrices in various formats.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Implements matrix multiplication, ensuring compatibility checks for differing shapes.
- **Concatenation**: Enables concatenating arrays and matrices along specified axes, ensuring shape compatibility.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
